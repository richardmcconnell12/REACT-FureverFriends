# Furever Friends
Furever Friends is my first full CRUD application using React. The idea for the app is to allow users to view a list of available pets in the Nashville area, and add them to their own interested pet page. The application allows the user to 

1. Add/delete a dog to their interested list
2. Add/edit/delete notes that a user has added to each pet

All data is specific to the user that is logged in. 

## Getting started

Furever Friends utilizes React, React-Router-DOM, and Material-UI for styling.
1. clone repo git@github.com:richardmcconnell12/REACT-FureverFriends.git
1. run ```npm install``` to pull in dependencies 
1. cd into api directory in another terminal window
1. run the JSON server at ```json-server -p 5002 -w database.json``` ( ```npm install -g json-server if necessary``` )
3. ```npm start``` in root directory to start the application
4. create a new account and log in.
